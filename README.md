# auto-clippi-trimmer
 Automatically trim the clips generated by clippi so they end slightly earlier. Meant for the json files generated by Project Clippi, a tool for processing Slippi replays.  
 This is a python script, so you must install a Python interpreter on your PC before it will work.

Installing Python is rather easy. You can even get it from the Windows Store by searching for "Python".  



# About
Thank you to @monnorail#0471 on the Slippi Discord for writing and sharing this script.  
I don't have any experience with writing Python scripts myself, so please don't make any feature requests.
