# How to Use
This is a Python script, so you must install a Python interpreter on your PC before it will work.  
For Windows 10+, you can install it from the Microsoft Store by searching for "Python".  

You can confirm whether Python is installed by launching a cmd window and typing the following:  
`python --version`  
If the command is recognized and returns a version number, then Python is installed.  
Example:  
`>python --version  
Python 3.9.11`

If these steps aren't working for you, then follow this guide: https://realpython.com/run-python-scripts/  




# auto-clippi-trimmer
 Automatically trim the clips generated by clippi so they end slightly earlier. Meant for the json files generated by Project Clippi, a tool for processing Slippi replays.  

Installing Python is rather easy. You can even get it from the Windows Store by searching for "Python".
